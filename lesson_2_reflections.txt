What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-When you initialize a repository, git creates a hidden folder (.git) for metadata purposes. I'm not really sure what that metadata contains...


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-The staging area is an intermediate area where you put files you want to add to a commit. If there wouldn't be this intermediate area, git would probably just add all modified files to a commit but by doing this the commit wouldn't have a single logical purpose.
When we modify multiple files we can git add them separately in groups so we can make multiple meaningful commits instead of a single and big unmeaningful commit.
